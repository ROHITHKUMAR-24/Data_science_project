# Predictive Analysis of Bank Marketing Campaigns: Subscribing to Term Deposits
## Project Overview:
This project focuses on analyzing and predicting the success of direct marketing campaigns conducted by a Portuguese banking institution. The goal is to determine whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on various features collected during the marketing campaigns.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information related to direct marketing campaigns via phone calls. It includes various attributes such as client demographics, previous campaign outcomes, and economic indicators. The target variable is a binary classification indicating whether the client subscribed to a term deposit ('yes' or 'no').

## Project Structure
- Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features.

- Model Training:Using a Random Forest Classifier to predict the subscription outcome.

- Model Evaluation:Assessing the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

- Feature Importance: Identifying the most influential features in the prediction model.

## Requirements
  To run this project, you need the following Python libraries:

- pandas

- scikit-learn

- matplotlib

- seaborn




## Results
The project evaluates the performance of the Random Forest Classifier and provides insights into the most important features influencing the subscription decision. 
The results include:

- Confusion Matrix

- Classification Report

- Accuracy Score

- Feature Importance Plot
